What is the best method you can tell your accounting department to use?','Tags can be used for resources and log groups in order to identify which department to bill.','The best solution for your accounting department would be to use tags to identify the department that resources should be billed to. Tags will allow them to filter views in Amazon Cost Explorer. While your accounting department could certainly track usage manually, it is not the best method. You could prefix the names of most things with a department code, but that is a very manual process and not as easy to filter on.',1),(33,'Your security team has contacted you with concerns regarding the activity of a user in the AWS Management Console. Which service allows you to view all of the activity that was generated under their account?','AWS CloudTrail','AWS CloudTrail allows you to audit all API access including access from the AWS Management Console, AWS API, and the AWS CLI. While AWS IAM gives you the ability to add users and specify how they will authenticate and be authorized to use services, it does not provide auditing.

In this case, the value is 2021-01-01T00:00:00Z, which is the ISO 8601 representation of January 1, 2021 at 0:00 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). The aws:CurrentTime key requires the time to be specified in ISO 8601 format. DateBefore is not a valid condition operator.

What two ways represent the most secure way of granting the application access to a DynamoDB table?','IAM roles & Instance profiles.','The most secure way to grant access to DynamoDB is to create an IAM role and link that role to the instance using an instance profile. When you create an IAM role using the IAM console, the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role to which it corresponds. If you use the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK to create a role, you create the role and instance profile as separate actions, with potentially different names. An instance profile can contain only one IAM role.

(AND) On the security group attached to the application load balancer, add an outbound rule for HTTP.','',5),(60,'You have an EC2 instance running a web service with an HTTPS endpoint. The instance has two network interfaces, and the web application listens only on the secondary interface. The primary interface is reserved for SSH management traffic. A public-facing network load balancer is configured to listen on TCP port 443 and forward traffic to the instance. What 3 things are the most secure way to ensure the instance receives HTTPS connections from clients on the Internet? ','Create a new security group with an inbound rule allowing HTTPS access.   Attach the security group to the instance\'s secondary interface.  Attach the security group to the network load balancer.','',5),(61,'You\'ve created a new network access control list (NACL) and added a rule to allow inbound SSH access to a public subnet hosting some EC2 instances, but you\'re unable to SSH to these instances. You\'ve verified that you have the correct SSH key pair, that the SSH service is running on each instance, and that each instance\'s security group has an inbound rule permitting SSH from your public IP address. What should you do to resolve the issue?','Add an outbound NACL list rule allowing all traffic.','NACLs are stateless and require an outbound rule to explicitly allow return traffic on an ephemeral port. Because the ephemeral port range varies by operating system, creating an outbound NACL rule allowing all traffic is sufficient. Security groups are stateful and thus don\'t require an explicit outbound rule to permit return traffic.',5),(62,'When you create an IAM principal, by default it has no permissions. Which of the following is this an example of?','Whitelisting.','Whitelisting is the practice of denying all permissions by default and granting only those specifically required.',5),(63,'In IAM, What are two examples of blacklisting?','Applying an identity-based policy to allow all actions for all services and on all resources.Applying an identity-based policy to explicitly deny the TerminateInstances action.
